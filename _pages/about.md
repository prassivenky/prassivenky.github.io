I am Prasannavenkatesh Balaji. I was born in Peralam, a Tamil-speaking town in the Thiruvarur district in Tamil Nadu, the southernmost Indian state. My life revolves around dogs, Origami, Carnatic music and trustworthy(?) AI, in that specific order.

Fundamentally, I have had an interest in probability and uncertainty quantification. Within the AI domain, I am interested in safety-critical applications of machine vision like autonomous driving. I currently work as a Scientific Officer at the German Centre for Rail Traffic Research in Dresden, a research centre under Germany's Federal Railway Authority. I primarily focus on trustworthy machine learning approaches for robust perception in ATO - autonomous train operation.

Earlier, I worked as a research intern at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg on the spatial resolution performance of telephoto cameras used for ADAS. I also wrote my master thesis there - on the detrimental impact of vehicle windshields on the performance of AI models (neural networks) in dense perception tasks like semantic segmentation.
